Ideas:

- putting an emoji at the end of the page
- productivity tool that sends you a list of motivation videos
    - when extension is enabled
        - a timer is set on various websites
        - once timer runs out, you will be routed to willâ€™s videos or more motivational videos





To do:
1. make a timer that can count down and show up on webpage
    -reddit, instagram, twitter

2. make an array of motivational videos 
3. reroute to random video or display video in browser somehow
4. make the webpage where the timer ran out inaccessible for a while
